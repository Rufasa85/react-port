            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Im just a dude who loves cats, fish, colors named after fish, UI that is vaugely reminscent of the 1990s, and Jurassic Park.  I have two cats, Shiva, whom my wife named after the Hindu diety, and Bahamut, who I named after the Final Fantasy summon. I later came to learn that Bahamut is also a mythical figure.  According to an <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamut" target="_blank">ancient Islamic tradition</a>, Bahamut is the fish upon which stands the ox upon which stands the man upon which sits the Earth.  That's a pretty big fish, and as we have already established, I think fish are pretty cool. What else? I would say I am the worlds top expert on manatee puns (I wrote the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/101-Manatee-Jokes-Joe-Rehfuss/dp/152015738X" target="_blank">book</a>), in my spare time I enjoy board games and rock climbing, and as get older I find birds to be cooler and cooler, furthering the stereotype that men in their 30s get really into birds for some reason.  This terrifies me. </p>
